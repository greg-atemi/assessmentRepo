This repository has the following modules

Fibonacci class  
List Maximum difference class  
SQL query  
Averagecalculator class  


# Fibonacci class
This Java class implements the Fibonacci sequence problem. It enables the user to provide an input, the function then generates the Fibonacci sequence of numbers up to the inputted number. The class also features error and exemption handling capabilities to validate user input

# List Maximum difference class
This Java class implements the List Maximum difference problem. It enables the user to provide a list as input, the function then calculates the maximum diffrence. This is done by finding the difference between the highest and the lowest numbers. The class also features error and exemption handling capabilities to validate user input

# SQL query
This function involves querying of the Employee database to filter the data based on the specified criteria

# Averagecalculator class 
This Java class implements the Averagecalculator debugging problem. The class initially has a bug. The bug itself involves division of an integer value with a double value. This often leads to truncation of the division result since the two data types are not the same. This is avoided by initializing both the total and the result variables with the double data type.
